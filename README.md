# PWA-TextEditor

## Description
This is a text editor that can be used on the web or as a desktop app. One of the best feautures about it is that you don't even need to have internet to use the desktop app. Whether you're using it for simple note taking or just practicing some code this is a good app for you.

## Usage 
Open the link attached to the README to open the text editor site and from there you can decide whether or not you want to install it or just you it on your browser. If the insall button isn't working then just refresh the page quick and should work and you can install the app.
